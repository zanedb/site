### Highlights

Hack Pennsylvania was a 24-hour hackathon we hosted in State College, PA on January 19-20, 2019. We brought together 111 students from around the state to build projects, learn to code, and meet new people.

Pre-event, I created a custom email sending & tracking platform which we used to contact schools in the area. We were able to reach dozens of schools, many of which put up flyers.

At the time, I was working on a Rails app called [Dash ✨](/portfolio/dash), which I modeled after our event’s needs. It handled everything from attendee registration to check-in, equipment rental waivers, and project submission.

Our team after 48 hours of remarkably little sleep.
