### Highlights

- From 2018-2020, I was involved in [several](https://hackpenn.com) [hackathons](https://2018.hackchicago.io).
- I built a Rails app to manage these events (and more!).
- It handled attendee registration, check-in, equipment rental waivers, and more.
- It was my largest project (almost 1k attendees used it!)
- Ultimately, COVID happened, but Iâ€™m still incredibly proud of it.

### Background

From 2018 to 2020, I was involved in a [ton](https://2018.hackchicago.io) [of](https://2019-site.windyhacks.com/) [hackathons](https://hackpenn.com). After my first leadership experience at [Hack Chicago](https://2018.hackchicago.io), I found myself to be redeploying similar tooling for each event. Things like attendee registration forms, check-ins, and equipment management weren't designed around hackathon use cases.

So I built a Rails app called Dash âœ¨.

It handled attendee management:

And hardware rentals:

I even built a React interface for event organizers to design a custom form, which would tie into the API:

We all know what happened in 2020, and by the time hackathons had come back, I had moved on. But I'm really proud of what I created here.

In total, 878 attendees signed up through Dash across 5 hackathons. I still canâ€™t believe that many people used a part of my *first web app* ðŸ¤¯.

Iâ€™ve open-sourced [the codebase](https://github.com/zanedb/dash) if you want to poke around, though beware itâ€™s years old and I canâ€™t guarantee any best practices.
