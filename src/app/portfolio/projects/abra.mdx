Inspired by [@matthewstanciu](https://matthewstanciu.com), I’m building an iOS app that saves your location on every Shazam. Right now, it’s just a map and a list.

In the future, it’ll create location-based playlists, as well as show relevant photos/calendar events/other context from when you found the song.

I frequently find myself wondering how/where I found a song, and the answer is often just a row in the Shazam app. I think this app will provide a lot more fun context.
