### ⚠️ In progress

Inspired by my friend [Matthew](https://matthewstanciu.com), I’m building a Shazam wrapper that saves your location with each entry. At the moment, it’s a map and a list.

In the future, it’ll create location-based playlists, as well as show relevant photos/calendar events/other context from when you found the song.

I frequently find myself wondering how/where I first found a song, and the answer is far too often just a row in the Shazam app. I intend for Abra to provide a much more detailed look into how we discover music.
